.. _overview:

**xOmics** (eXplainable Omics) is a Python framework developed for streamlined and explainable omics analysis, with a
spotlight on differential proteomics expression data. It introduces the following key algorithms:

- **cImpute**: Conditional Imputation - A transparent method for hybrid missing value imputation.
- **pRank**: Protein-centric ranking of (prote)omic data, leveraging functional enrichment results.
- **pIntegrate**: Protein-centric integration of multiple (prote)omic datasets to find commonalities and differences.

In addition, **xOmics** provides functional capabilities for efficiently loading benchmark proteomics datasets via
**load_datasets**, accompanied by corresponding enrichment data.A suite of supportive functions is also available to
facilitate a smooth and efficient (prote)omic analysis pipeline.
