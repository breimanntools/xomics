Introduction
============

**xOmics** (eXplainable Omics) is a Python framework developed for streamlined and explainable omics analysis, with a
spotlight on differential proteomics expression data.

Workflow
--------
A typical workflow involves missing the following algorithms:

- **cImpute**: Conditional Imputation - A transparent method for hybrid missing value imputation.
- **xOmicsIntegrate**: Protein-centric integration of multiple (prote)omic datasets to find commonalities and differences.
- **xOmicsRank**: Protein-centric ranking of (prote)omic data, leveraging functional enrichment results.

Missing value imputation, data integration, and protein-centric ranking can all be performed independently.
