Data Flow and Enry Points
=========================

Data Flow: Components of xOmics
-------------------------------

The AAanalysis toolkit uses different DataFrames. It starts with DataFrames containing amino acid scales information
(**df_scales**, **df_cat**) or protein sequence information (**df_seq**). Sequences can be segmented into sequence
parts (**df_parts**), which can be split, as defined by **split_kws**. Amino acid scales and sequence parts together
with split settings are the input for the CPP algorithm, creating various physicochemical features (**df_feat**) by
comparing two sets of protein sequences.
