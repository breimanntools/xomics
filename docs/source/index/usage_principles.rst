   This is the index file that outlines the usage principles for the xOmics package.
   Files for individual usage principles are stored in the /usage_principles directory.

   This document provides an overview of:
   - Component diagram (illustrating internal dependencies)
   - Context diagram (depicting external dependencies)

   Instead of including comprehensive tables here, refer to tables in tables.rst with concise explanations.
   Always include brief code examples that mirror the corresponding usage examples.
