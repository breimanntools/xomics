Vision
======

Objectives
----------

- Establish a comprehensive toolkit for interpretable, sequence-based protein prediction.
- Enable robust learning from small and unbalanced datasets, common in life sciences.
- Integrate seamlessly with machine learning and explainable AI libraries such as `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
  and `SHAP <https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
- Offer flexible interoperability with other Python packages like `biopython <https://biopython.org/>`_.

Non-goals
---------

- Reimplementation of existing solutions.
- Ignoring the biological context.
- Cherry-picking of biological hits.

Principles
----------

- Algorithms should be biologically inspired and combine empirical insights with cutting-edge computational methods.
- We emphasize fair, accountable, and transparent machine learning, as detailed
  in `Interpretable Machine Learning with Python <https://www.packtpub.com/product/interpretable-machine-learning-with-python/9781800203907>`_.
- We're committed to offering diverse evaluation metrics and interpretable visualizations, aiming to extend to other
  aspects of interpretable data analysis and explainable AI such as causal inference.


Bug Reports
===========

For effective bug reports, please include a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE):

- **Minimal**: Include the least amount of code to demonstrate the issue.
- **Self-contained**: Ensure all necessary data and imports are included.
- **Reproducible**: Confirm the example reliably replicates the issue.

Further guidelines can be found `here <https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports>`_.

- Is up-to-date with the master branch and passes all tests.

Preview Changes
---------------

To preview documentation changes in pull requests, follow the "docs/readthedocs.org" check link under "All checks have passed".


Documentation
=============

Documentation is a crucial part of the project. If you make any modifications to the documentation,
please ensure they render correctly.

Naming Conventions
------------------

We strive for consistency of our public interfaces with well-established libraries like
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_, and `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_.

Class Templates
"""""""""""""""

We primarily use one class templates for organizing our codebase:

- **Tool**: Standalone classes that focus on specialized tasks, such as feature engineering for protein prediction.
  They feature `.run` and `.eval` methods to carry out the complete processing pipeline and generate various evaluation metrics.

The remaining classes should fulfill two further purposes, without being directly implemented using class inheritance.

- **Data visualization**: Supplementary plotting classes for `Tool` classes. These classes implement
    an `.eval` method to visualize the key evaluation measures.
- **Analysis support**: Supportive pre-processing classes for `Tool` classes.

Function and Method Naming
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We semi-strictly adhere to the naming conventions established by the aforementioned libraries. Functions/Methods
processing data values should correspond with the names specified in our primary `pd.DataFrame` columns, as defined in
`xomics/_utils/_utils_constants.py`.

Code Philosophy
---------------

We aim for a modular, robust, and easily extendable codebase. Therefore, we adhere to using flat class hierarchies
(i.e., only inheriting from `Tool` is recommended and using classes as container for data and functionality)
and functional programming principles, as outlined in
`A Philosophy of Software Design <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3288797>`_.
Our goal is to provide a user-friendly public interface using concise description and
`Python type hints <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ (see also this Python Enhancement Proposal
`PEP 484 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/>`_
or the `Robust Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/robust-python/9781098100650/>`_ book).
For the validation of user inputs, we use comprehensive checking functions with descriptive error messages.

Documentation Style
-------------------

- **Docstring Style**: We use the `Numpy Docstring style <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ and
  adhere to the `PEP 257 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/>`_ docstring conventions.

- **Code Style**: Please follow the `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ and
  `PEP 20 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/>`_ style guides for Python code.

- **Markup Language**: Documentation is in reStructuredText (.rst). See for an introduction (
  `reStructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_) and for
  cheat sheets (`reStructureText Cheatsheet <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.2/rst-cheatsheet.html>`_ or
  `Sphinx Tutorial <https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/cheatsheet/>`_).

- **Autodoc**: We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_
  for automatic inclusion of docstrings in the documentation, including its
  `autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_,
  `napoleon <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_, and
  `sphinx-design <https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-theme/>`_ extensions.

- **Further Details**: See our `conf.py <https://github.com/breimanntools/xomics/blob/master/docs/source/conf.py>`_
  for more.

Documentation Layers
---------------------
This project's documentation is organized across four distinct layers, each with a specific focus and level of detail:

- **Docstrings**: Concise code description, with minimal usage examples and references to other layers (in 'See also').

- **Usage Principles**: Bird's-eye view with background and key principles, reflecting by selected code examples.

- **Tutorial**: Close-up on public interface, as step-by-step guide on essential usage with medium detail.

- **Tables**:  Close-up on data or other tabular overviews, with detailed explanation of columns and critical values.

See our reference order here (exceptions confirm the rules):

.. image :: /docs/source/_artwork/diagrams/ref_order.png

The `API <https://xomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ showcases **Docstrings** for our public objects
and functions. Within these docstrings, scientific
`References <https://xomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index/references.html>`_
may be mentioned in their extended sections. For additional links in docstrings, use the *See Also* section in this order:
`Usage Principles <https://xomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index/usage_principles.html>`_,
`Tables <https://xomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index/tables.html>`_,
`Tutorials <https://xomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_. Only include **External library** references
when absolutely necessary. Note that the Usage Principles documentation is open for direct linking to References,
Tutorials, and Tables, which can as well include links to References.

Building the Docs
-----------------

To generate the documentation locally:

- Go to the `docs` directory.
- Run `make html`.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd docs
  make html

- Open `_build/html/index.html` in a browser.
